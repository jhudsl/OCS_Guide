name: New Official Case Study Submission
about: If you would like your case study to be submitted to be a part of our official collection please fill out the following information and make sure your case study meets these requirements. 

Note that we only plan to accept roughly two case studies per year to start at the discretion of the Open Case Studies faculty. We hope to grow our capacity to accept new case studies over time. Acceptance of case studies into the official Open Case Studies collection will not necessarily be on a first come first serve basis but will be based on the Open Case Studies faculty choice which will involve consideration of: 

- the quality of the data science work presented in the case study
- the quality of the instruction within the case study
- if the case study fills a niche currently not present in our collection
- if it is a useful and interesting topic
